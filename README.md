CANbus steering wheel control to USB keyboard emulator.
Translates VW/Audi CANbus SWC buttons to extended keyboard next/prev track, volume, play/pause, and power button.

I used an STM32F429-Discovery and STM's HAL code, makes using this microcontroller VERY easy.

This was for my tablet (Kindle Fire) mounting in my car's dash, as a headunit replacement.
